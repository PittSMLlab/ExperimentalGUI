### BrainWalk — Stability Notice

**Lead experimenters:** Shuqi Liu, Jiwon Choi.

BrainWalk is a multi-year longitudinal study. Participants return for
visits one year apart, and all procedures must be identical across
visits and across all participants. **Do not make functional changes**
to `BrainWalkProtocol.m` or to the controllers it invokes
(`OGNBackTask`, `NirsAutomaticityAssessment`). Formatting changes are
acceptable; logic changes are not.

### SpinalAdapt — Protocol Notes

**Lead experimenter:** Chase Rock (post-doctoral fellow).
**Key experimenters:** Shuqi Liu, Nate Brantly. Data collection is
planned to resume approximately July 2026; protocol software updates
may be required before collection resumes. See
[studies/SpinalAdapt/README.md](studies/SpinalAdapt/README.md).

Subject ID formats: `SABH##` (healthy controls), `SAS##V##` (stroke,
two visits). Speed parameters default to a fast:slow ratio of 0.7
(i.e., slow = 0.7 × fast speed) with an abrupt split (no ramp); this
was changed from a 0.5 ratio and gradual ramp after participant SABH16
(July 2024).

H-reflex stimulation requires an Arduino Uno running the firmware in
`HreflexStimArduino/`. See `HreflexStimArduino/README.md` for the
complete upload procedure, hardware wiring, and pre-experiment
checklist.

Overground (OG) baseline trials use `HreflexOGWithAudio` (menu slot
16). The speed feedback range in that controller must be adjusted
manually between participants because the comfortable overground
walking speed varies. Calibration trials use `NirsHreflexOpenLoopWithAudio`
(menu slot 14).

## Controller Reference

The `controllers/` folder contains the active controllers listed below
plus three supporting utility functions (`generateNbackRestEventString`,
`generateNirsRestEventString`, `nirsEvent`). Inactive backup variants
have been moved to `controllers/Deprecated/` and are preserved there
for reference.

### Key Controllers for New Development

**Primary starting points** for new experimental protocols:

- `controlSpeedWithSteps_edit1_AudioCountDown` (slot 11) — split-belt
  treadmill with audio countdown; recommended base for new treadmill
  protocols
- `HreflexOGWithAudio` (slots 8/16) — overground walking with H-reflex
  triggers and audio speed feedback; recommended base for new overground
  protocols

**Use-case-specific** key controllers:

| Controller | Slot | Use when the protocol needs |
|---|---|---|
| `NirsHreflexOpenLoopWithAudio` | 14 | fNIRS event markers + H-reflex |
| `NirsAutomaticityAssessment` | 10 | Overground fNIRS dual-task |
| `OGNBackTask` | 13 | Overground N-back cognitive dual-task |

All other controllers in the table below are study-specific or legacy
variants and are not recommended as starting points for new protocols.

GUI menu slot numbers correspond to `case` labels in
`Execute_button_Callback` (AdaptationGUI.m lines 374–544).

| Menu Slot | Controller | Description | Used By |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `controlSpeedWithSteps_edit1` | Basic split-belt controller; fixed speed profile without self-selected speed calibration phase. | General / standalone use |
| 2–4 | `controlSpeedWithSteps_selfSelect` | Primary split-belt treadmill controller. Stride-synchronized belt updates; establishes self-selected speed baseline. Slot 2 = signed, 3 = unsigned, 4 = closed-loop. | General treadmill adaptation protocols |
| 7 | `controlSpeedWithSteps_selfSelect_OneClick` | One-click-start variant; trial ends on single response. Used for stride-length based perceptual trials. | Perceptual Adaptation (stride-based) |
| 9 | `controlSpeedWithSteps_PercAdap` | Perceptual adaptation variant; trial ends on click response, task length is time-based. | Perceptual Adaptation |
| 11 | `controlSpeedWithSteps_edit1_AudioCountDown` | Split-belt controller with audio countdown cue at trial start. | BrainWalk (TM trials), C3 (TM trials) |
| 15 | `controlSpeedWithSteps_WeberPerceptionFaster` | Weber perception variant; faster inter-stride update for threshold estimation. | Weber Perception |
| 8 | `HreflexOGWithAudio` | Overground (no belt control) with H-reflex triggers and audio speed feedback. | BrainWalk (OG baseline), C3 (OG baseline) |
| 16 | `HreflexOGWithAudio` | Same controller, second menu entry; used for H-reflex OG trials with audio in SpinalAdapt. | SpinalAdapt |
| 14 | `NirsHreflexOpenLoopWithAudio` | Split-belt controller with fNIRS event markers, H-reflex stimulation, and audio feedback. | NirsAutomaticityProtocol, SpinalAdapt (calibration) |
| 10 | `NirsAutomaticityAssessment` | Overground alphabet dual-task assessment. Records responses and logs events. | BrainWalk, NirsAutomaticityProtocol |
| 12 | `Dulce_grad_betarev2` | H-reflex gradient computation tool (grad project). | Standalone H-reflex analysis |

## Creating a New Experimental Protocol

### Overview

A new protocol requires three components:

1. A `generateProfiles_<StudyName>.m` script to generate speed profiles
2. A `RunProtocol_<StudyName>.m` script to sequence trials and call the GUI
3. Optionally, a new controller in `controllers/` if none of the existing
   ones fit the experimental design

### Step-by-Step

**Step 1 — Create a study folder**

```
studies/<StudyName>/
    generateProfiles_<StudyName>.m
    RunProtocol_<StudyName>.m
```

**Step 2 — Write the profile generator**

`generateProfiles_<StudyName>.m` must produce two Nx1 vectors:
- `velL` — left belt speeds in mm/s for each stride
- `velR` — right belt speeds in mm/s for each stride

A `NaN` at position k signals a self-paced stride: the controller holds
or queries the current treadmill speed instead of commanding a preset
value. Profiles are passed directly to the controller as arguments —
there is no file-based loading at runtime.

```matlab
% Example: 50-stride baseline at 800 mm/s, then 100-stride adaptation
% with 2:1 speed ratio, then 50-stride post-adaptation
velL = [repmat(800, 50, 1);  repmat(800, 100, 1);  repmat(800, 50, 1)];
velR = [repmat(800, 50, 1);  repmat(1600, 100, 1); repmat(800, 50, 1)];
```

**Step 3 — Choose a controller**

Consult the [Controller Reference](#controller-reference) table. For a
standard split-belt adaptation paradigm, start with
`controlSpeedWithSteps_selfSelect`. If you need features not present in
any existing controller (e.g., a new peripheral, a novel feedback
signal), copy the closest existing controller, rename it following
camelCase convention, and modify it.

**Step 4 — Add a new controller to the GUI (if needed)**

If you created a new controller, register it in `AdaptationGUI`:

1. Open `AdaptationGUI.fig` in GUIDE and add the controller name to the
   `popupmenu2` string list.
2. In `AdaptationGUI.m`, locate `Execute_button_Callback` and add a
   `case` for the new controller name that calls it with the appropriate
   arguments (follow the pattern of existing cases).

**Step 5 — Write the protocol script**

`RunProtocol_<StudyName>.m` should:
1. Open `AdaptationGUI` and obtain its `handles` struct
2. For each trial block, set `handles.popupmenu1` (profile) and
   `handles.popupmenu2` (controller) to the desired values, then call
   `Execute_button_Callback` (or prompt the experimenter to click Execute)
3. Use `questdlg` calls to pace the experimenter through the session and
   confirm readiness before each trial

See `studies/SpinalAdapt/RunProtocol_SpinalAdaptBouts.m` or
`studies/C3/RunProtocol_C3.m` as reference implementations.

**Step 6 — Test before participant data collection**

Run the protocol with a short dummy profile (e.g., 5 strides) in the
lab with the treadmill at low speed to verify that belt commands,
data logging, and data transfer all work as expected before involving
participants.

## Hardware Setup: Bertec Treadmill

### What the Code Provides

- **Communication:** UDP connection initialized once per trial in
  `sendTreadmillPacket` (from labTools).
- **Packet format:** 64 bytes — 1 format byte, 9 int16 values
  (speedR, speedL, speedRR, speedLL, accR, accL, accRR, accLL,
  incline), 1 checksum byte (255 − sum of data bytes), 27 padding bytes.
- **Hard limits enforced by `getPayload`:** speed ±6500 mm/s,
  acceleration ≤ 3000 mm/s². Commands outside these ranges are clipped.

### Bertec Sync Software Settings

> [TODO: Document the expected Bertec Sync software settings here,
> including UDP port configuration, force-plate zeroing procedure,
> and any required startup steps before running an experiment.]

## Hardware Setup: Vicon Nexus 2.12

### Marker Set and Capture Settings

> [TODO: Document the marker set used (e.g., Plug-in Gait or custom),
> the expected capture frame rate (e.g., 100 Hz), and the labeling
> template name loaded in Nexus before each session.]

### EMG: Delsys Trigno Wireless System

Surface EMG is recorded using a Delsys Trigno wireless system. Data
are acquired in Nexus 2.12 across two separate, synchronized PCs
(one per leg). Both PCs must be connected to the same Nexus system
before capture begins.

> [TODO: Document the Delsys Trigno channel configuration (sensor
> mapping, muscle assignment) and the dual-PC synchronization
> procedure in Nexus.]

### C3D Output

> [TODO: Document the expected C3D output path convention and any
> naming requirements for compatibility with downstream analysis
> pipelines (e.g., labTools processing scripts).]

## Other Instrumentation

### Artenis fNIRS Headband

Used in the BrainWalk study to record prefrontal cortex oxygenation
during cognitive dual-task walking. The headband is synchronized with
the treadmill trial via event markers inserted by
`NirsAutomaticityAssessment` and `OGNBackTask` controllers.

> [TODO: Document headband placement, channel configuration, and
> synchronization procedure with Nexus.]

### Wii Remote

Used in perceptual studies (Perceptual Adaptation, Weber Perception)
for two-alternative forced choice responses. Participants press left or
right button to indicate perceived faster belt.

> [TODO: Document Bluetooth pairing procedure and which MATLAB
> toolbox or driver is required.]

### Arduino H-Reflex Stimulator

Used in SpinalAdapt and NirsAutomaticityProtocol. The Arduino
interface is in `HreflexStimArduino/`. Stimulation timing is triggered
by the `NirsHreflexOpenLoopWithAudio` and `HreflexOGWithAudio`
controllers.

**Hardware:** Arduino Uno + two Digitimer DS8R constant-current
stimulators. The Arduino reads force-plate Fz voltage on analog pins
A0 (left) and A1 (right) to detect heel strikes and toe-offs, and
delivers 20 ms trigger pulses on digital pins 8 (right stim) and 9
(left stim). Vicon sync outputs are on pins 11 (right) and 12 (left).

**Firmware:** Upload
`triggerStimWithGaitStateMachine_SpeedIndependent.ino` from the
`HreflexStimArduino/` folder. See `HreflexStimArduino/README.md` for
the complete step-by-step upload procedure (board: Arduino Uno;
baud rate: 115200).

**Stimulus intensity calibration:** Performed at the start of each
session using the calibration trials in `RunProtocol_SpinalAdaptBouts.m`
(`runWalkingCalibrations.m`). The experimenter adjusts DS8R output
current until H-reflex responses of approximately 10–20% of maximum
M-wave are observed in the EMG signal.

> [TODO: Document the detailed DS8R current ramp procedure and the
> Delsys EMG channels used for H-reflex response monitoring.]
